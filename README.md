Okay however, Im Fabi 19 and i do a little programming.
I could make a giant list of all programminglanguages i ever touched but idc. Im kinda good at node (web basics bruh), JAVA and C#. 

Currently im in a prgogramming school and i really hope to get out soon. (Its very annoying because i like programming and not the other trash they want to teach me)
